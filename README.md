# Collecting

The Collecting module allows you to gather public contributions through your sites. Users can upload files or submit textual entries along with some identifying metadata, which your site administrators can then moderate and approve for inclusion.

Collecting forms are configured on a site-by-site basis. It adds a section to your Site Settings page, and adds a link under each Site for Collecting forms. Forms are added to site pages by way of page blocks.

Collecting integrates with the Custom Vocab, Mapping, and Numeric Data Types modules.

The Add Collecting Form page has two sections: the first has a set of fields and options for you to complete; the second is where you add and edit the prompts which will make up the form that site visitors see and fill out.

Items added via a collecting form will appear in the Items section of the admin dashboard, but you may find it easier to manage them through the Collecting tab of the site through which they were collected.

A collected item can have one of three status messages: Needs Review, Public, and Private. When you update the status of an item from "Needs Review" to either "Public" or "Private", your name will appear in the row for that item as the user the item has been Reviewed by. If you have multiple people working on a site, this can help you keep track of who has approved the collected items.
